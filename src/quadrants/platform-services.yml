      <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic Search</a> is an open source
      search platform. It is an extensible, multi-tenanted, and horizontally
      scalable search solution based on Apache Lucene. It allows complex data
      structures to be indexed and retrieved through a JSON based REST API. It
      provides an elegant model of operation with automatic discovery of peers
      in a cluster, failover, and replication. Elastic Search can be extended
      with a plugin system that allows adding new functionality and changing
      existing behavior. The community around this tool is quite vibrant as
      illustrated by the number of client libraries available in languages like
      Java, C#, Ruby, and JavaScript.

    description: >
      For problems that fit the document database model, <a
      href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> is now the most popular
      choice. In addition to ease of use and a solid technical implementation,
      the community and ecosystem contributed to this success. We are aware of
      problems where teams were tempted by the popularity of MongoDB when a
      document database was not a good fit or they did not understand the
      inherent complexity. When used appropriately, however, MongoDB has proven
      itself on many projects.
